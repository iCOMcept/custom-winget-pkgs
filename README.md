# iCOMcept WinGet manifests

This repository is home to the manifests that are consumed by the [iCOMcept WinGet REST source](https://github.com/iCOMcept/custom-winget-poc).

The folder structure is modeled after the [Windows Package Manager Community Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs) to ensure compatibility with the WinGet client.

Manifests are created using the official [Windows Package Manager Manifest Creator](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-create).
